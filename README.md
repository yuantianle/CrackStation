# CrackStation

## 1. A description of your library. What does your library do? What’s it for? Why might someone want to use it or care?

**POC v1:** My application do ONE word long password decryption. It is for people who wanna do password decryption for hash value generated by one character `^[a-zA-Z0-9?!]$` with `SHA1` algorithm. They forget their password, collect customer information or just want to be a hacker.

**POC v2:** My application do TWO words long password decryption. It is for people who wanna do password decryption for hash value generated by one to two characters `^[a-zA-Z0-9?!]{1,2}$` with `SHA1` algorithm. People want to use the station when they forget their password, collect customer information or just want to be a hacker.


## 2. A description of how to use it. What’s the public API, etc?

**POC v1:** There is an api called `decrypt`. After include `CrackStation` from the library, you can use the function `decrypt()` to decrypt passwords. `CrackStation.decrypt()` is the public API you can include.

**POC v2:** Based on `POC v1` I also added Decrypter as a protocol to make the using of `decrypt()` more structured. But the method to use the function is the same.


## 3. The version of the latest stable release. Use Semantic Versioning 2.0.0. Your release number most likely is 1.0.0.

**POC v1:** The released version is `v1.0.0`, which is corresponding to decryption for hash value with 1 and 2 character passwords by `SHA1`.

**POC v2:** The recent released version is `v2.0.0`, which is corresponding to decryption for hash value with 1 to 2 characters passwords by `SHA1`.

## 4.The author’s name. That is, your name. So we know whose work we are looking at.

**POC v1:** Tianle Yuan. 

**POC v2:** Tianle Yuan. You can also call me Mark :)
